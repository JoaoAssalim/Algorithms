"""
Uses Dijkstra concepts but with heuristic to make it faster and better.

It works similarly to dijkstra without edge weights, but
it has an "extra" weight for detecting its shortest path, which works in the following steps:

    - Calculates the heuristic distance from the desired node to each node
    - Measures the distance from the starting node to the next node by adding the weight of the edges with the weight of the node (measuring the distance from the current node to the destination node and only the weight of the current node)
    - With each measurement it adds the node with the shortest distance to the top of a queue and when the node has no more visits it is removed
